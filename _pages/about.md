[cite_start]My name is Sourav Das, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University[cite: 4, 9]. [cite_start]My background includes four years of professional experience as a piping design engineer [cite: 4] [cite_start] and my current research is deeply focused on the challenges of Li-ion battery degradation, diagnostics, and digital twin modeling[cite: 4].

[cite_start]I have a proven ability to lead complex projects, from industrial pipeline design for global EPC firms to pioneering novel battery analysis workflows[cite: 5]. [cite_start]This work has led to first-author publications and an R&D 100 Award[cite: 5].

[cite_start]I am currently seeking an R&D role where I can apply my skills in the Energy Storage technology or sustainable materials sector[cite: 6].
