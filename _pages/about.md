## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University, focused on tackling the complexities of lithium-ion battery degradation, diagnostics, and multiphysics modeling. With 4 years of prior experience as a design engineer, I enjoy connecting real-world engineering with cutting-edge research. My current work involves developing advanced battery analysis workflows using Python, MATLAB, and COMSOL, contributing to first-author publications and earning recognition with an R&D 100 Award. Passionate about improving energy storage reliability, Iâ€™m driven by the goal of building a more sustainable energy futureâ€”and always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a good conversation about energy storage systems.
