## About Me

Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University with a research focus on Li-ion battery degradation, diagnostics, and multiphysics modeling. I leverage 4 years of professional experience as a design engineer to bridge the gap between industrial application and academic research, contributing to novel battery analysis workflows that have resulted in an R&D 100 Award and first-author publications.

I am actively seeking an internship or co-op role where I can apply my expertise in energy storage and materials science to solve challenging industry problems.
