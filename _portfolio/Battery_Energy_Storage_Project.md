This project focuses on predicting and analyzing the complex degradation mechanisms in Li-ion batteries through in-situ and ex-situ analytical methods and the development of high-fidelity digital twin models.

### Key Accomplishments
* [cite_start]Engineered physics-informed digital twins to model battery degradation, improving failure prediction accuracy by over 15% under abusive conditions[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]Pioneered a novel diagnostic workflow correlating electrochemical and material analysis to pinpoint electrode failure modes, forming the basis for 2 upcoming first-author publications[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]Integrated multiphysics models with post-mortem analysis (SEM, XRD, ICP) to create green recycling strategies that increase recovery of critical materials by up to 90%[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]Designed a Machine Learning (ML)-driven charging protocol that suppresses lithium plating, extending battery cycle life by over 30% at high C-rates[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to accelerate project timelines by presenting weekly findings and adapting experimental plans based on shared insights[cite: 30].
