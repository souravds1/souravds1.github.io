This research involved using computational and mechanical testing methods to understand and characterize novel materials, from nanomaterials like graphene to biomaterials like sorghum.

### Key Accomplishments
* Modeled the mechanisms of polymer-to-graphene synthesis using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in LAMMPS.
* Characterized the mechanical properties (stalk strength, lodging resistance) of over 50 sorghum varieties using 3-point bending tests.
