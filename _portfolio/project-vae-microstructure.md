### Two-Stage Generative Pipeline

To generate high-quality synthetic microstructures, a two-stage pipeline was developed:

1.  **Denoising Variational Autoencoder (VAE):** A custom data-loading pipeline was built in **PyTorch** to create paired clean/noisy image examples. The VAE was trained to learn robust latent representations from data perturbed with three distinct noise models: salt-and-pepper flips, sinusoidal grid overlays, and frequency-domain masking using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

2.  **Latent Diffusion Model (LDM):** A diffusion model was trained in the VAEâ€™s learned latent space. This process iteratively refines the latent vectors, significantly improving the fidelity and quality of the final generated microstructure images compared to using a standalone VAE.

### Key Skills & Technologies Demonstrated
* **Generative Models:** Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
* **Framework & Libraries:** **PyTorch**
* **Techniques:** Denoising Autoencoders, Latent Space Diffusion, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for Data Augmentation, Custom Data-Loading Pipelines.
