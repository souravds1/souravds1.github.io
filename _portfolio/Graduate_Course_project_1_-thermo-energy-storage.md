### Project Abstract
Continuous and clean energy generation is the goal of all energy researchers. Research is going towards this goal. This report discusses some of the thermodynamic solutions CAES and LAES for electrical energy storage based on the Carnot Battery cycle. The process flow diagram and the different components of the systems have been presented. The benefit of Carbon di Oxide as a storage medium is also discussed. Some current and future utilization of this system other than electricity generation are also mentioned. Current constraints and limitations, along with some solutions to the system are also analyzed in this report.
