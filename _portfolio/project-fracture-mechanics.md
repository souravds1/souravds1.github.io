### Project Abstract
Bone is a naturally occurring composite substance with remarkable strength and toughness due to its internal hierarchical structure. Despite its unique characteristics, bone also has a semi-brittle behavior and can still experience fractures caused by accidents and surgeries. This paper will delve into the study of failure mechanisms in bone influenced by standard
