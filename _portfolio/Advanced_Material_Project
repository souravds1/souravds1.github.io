This research involved using computational and mechanical testing methods to understand and characterize novel materials, from nanomaterials like graphene to biomaterials like sorghum.


### Key Accomplishments
* [cite_start]Modeled the mechanisms of polymer-to-graphene synthesis using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in LAMMPS[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]Characterized the mechanical properties (stalk strength, lodging resistance) of over 50 sorghum varieties using 3-point bending tests[cite: 33].
