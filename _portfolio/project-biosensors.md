### 1. Glucose Oxidase Biosensor Fabrication

This study focused on the fabrication and characterization of a biosensor for glucose detection. The process involved immobilizing the glucose oxidase enzyme on an electrode and using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure its response to varying glucose concentrations.

### 2. Carbon Dots Synthesis for Iron (Fe³⁺) Sensing

This research involved the bottom-up synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots. The material's properties were then characterized, and its efficacy as a selective sensing agent for detecting Iron (Fe³⁺) ions in solution was successfully demonstrated through fluorescence quenching.
